"""SeekDB backend.

SeekDB (OceanBase) is MySQL-compatible and branches by forking whole
databases (copy-on-write, milliseconds) rather than keeping named branches
inside one database. Each of our branches is therefore its own database:

    main branch      -> <db_name>
    branch "X"       -> <db_name>__X

The mapping is derived from the names alone, so every worker (each with its
own connection) resolves the same branch to the same database with no shared
state.

SeekDB has no commits of its own. The verbs that need them are built from
two primitives it does have:

* ``current_scn()`` and flashback reads (``<table> AS OF SNAPSHOT <scn>``),
  which read a table as it was at an earlier SCN (kept for ``undo_retention``
  seconds; raise it with ``ALTER SYSTEM SET undo_retention = 86400``);
* ``FORK DATABASE`` / ``DROP DATABASE``.

A commit is a row in the branch database's ``_bb_commits`` table recording
the SCN the branch was at; forks copy that table, so a branch inherits its
parent's history. Each row also names the database whose flashback holds the
snapshot (a fork's tables have no history before the fork).

    branch     FORK DATABASE <parent db> TO <branch db>; from a commit,
               the fork's tables are then restored to that snapshot
    commit     INSERT INTO _bb_commits (id = current_scn())
    log        SELECT FROM _bb_commits
    diff       anti-joins between the two states (snapshots or heads)
    reset      restore every table from the commit's snapshot, in place
    revert     apply the inverse of the commit's (before, after) snapshots
    merge      SQL three-way merge: base = source's fork point, ours = the
               target database, theirs = the source database
    rebase     same three-way merge written into the branch, with base = the
               branch's fork point and theirs = the upstream branch
    delete     DROP DATABASE <branch db>

The three-way merge works per table with primary keys (rows are matched by
key; tables without one, like ``history``, only receive the other side's new
rows). Conflicts are rows both sides changed differently; ``on_conflict``
decides ("ours" | "theirs" | callable, see dblib.db_api). A table whose
columns were added on one side gets those columns on the other; a differing
primary key is a schema conflict and the verb fails without touching data.

``SEEKDB_NATIVE_MERGE=1`` switches merge() to SeekDB's own
``MERGE TABLE ... STRATEGY OURS|THEIRS`` per table, which has no common
ancestor (every differing row is a conflict and the source's deletes are
never applied) but measures the native primitive.

Because every branch is a database on the same server, a multi-ref script
can address another branch as `<db>__<branch>`.`<table>`.
